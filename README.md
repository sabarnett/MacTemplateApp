# Mac Template

I'm a bit new to writing Mac applications with SwiftUI. I've written a few iOS apps (entirely for my
own amusement) but my exposure to Mac development is minimal. As an ex-Windows developer
it's a natural progression to do Mac development, so I need to pull together some of the basic
concepts.

The best way to document this stuff is to create a template for a Mac application that includes all of
the basics like window layout, dialogs, menus and a few other things.

That's what this project is. It's a template that I am developing along side the creation of some
documentation on Mac development with SwiftUI. 

## Documentation

The documentation is in a Scrivener file, which I have not included here. It's a work in progress
and a long way from public release. However, in the Docs folder, you will find the latest PDF version
of the file. Until I get all the basic elements sorted out I'm not intending to do a proper review of the
content, so it's a little rough and the language isn't necessarily what you would expect of a 
professional publication. But, then, this isn't a professional publication and I have no intention of
publishing it, so that's all good.

## Updates

I intend to update this on a regular basis. The document may lag behind the code just because it's easier
to push the code than it is to re-generate the document. Sorry about that.
